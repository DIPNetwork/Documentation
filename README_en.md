Welcome to the dipnet.go wiki!
### Why we build DIPNET

DIPNET is a vertical public chain developed based on Ethereum. DIPNET has:  
- Contract paradigms  
- Incentives in the developer chain (development is mining)  
- DPOS & DAG double chain consensus  

We hope to build a user-friendly, developer-friendly blockchain technology, and move out the over focus on decentralization and consensus to more on specific businesses, direct users and first-line developers.

After entering the Internet era, the prosperity of the application platform often depends on its prosperous ecosystem. We can see from the success of android and IOS from forming benign value incentives among users, developers, and vendors. The success of these two systems is closely related to their APP store. Today's blockchain technology is developing rapidly, and a large number of new methods emerge in an endless stream. As a blockchain of application platforms, it is still a plaything of technical geeks.

We hope to attract more independent developers and help these good developers get incentives, both in honor and economics, just as what happen in the android and IOS app ecosystems, developers who organize in whatever form should receive a dignified reward for their wisdom; and look forward to a strong community. On the one hand, it completes the evangelism of blockchain technology, and delivers a fair, open and honest consensus concept to the world. On the other hand, it gathers the smartest brain, enriches the app ecology of the blockchain, and reduces the application threshold of the end of the blockchain, letting the technology of the blockchain be more brilliant, benefit more non-professionals, traditional enterprises, etc.
